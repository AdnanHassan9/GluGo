# GluGo
An integrated system of personalized diabetes management software, tools, and reports for patients wearing continuous glucose monitoring devices.

#Introduction
Glugo is a startup comprised of students at Wheaton College. We build software applications that enable people living with diabetes to better control their glucose levels. We seek to improve how current apps interpret and display glucose data (e.g. interactive graphs), and improve alerts using algorithms that predict highs and lows before they occur. We also want to enable user include other data (e.g. carb intake) to serve the above ends.
